# SearchEZ
Thanks for checking out SearchEZ!

SearchEZ is aimed to be a simple utility that will allow users to find the cheapest price of a product across various e-commerce websites.
Currently the program only implements a GUI that will give you the URL of searched keyword on Amazon, Flipkart and Ebay. (More sites to be added soon!)

For next patch:
1. Adding buttons next to the search URLs to directly open the link in your web browser.
2. Adding 2 more e-commerce websites.
3. Making the search window more attractive.

Remaining objectives:
1. Obtaining the desired product itself from the search URL.
2. Getting price of the product and sorting it, if product is unavailable on a site then it will be excluded.

Issues to be fixed:
1. Display the URLs text field only after the user has given the input.
2. Instead of hardcoding the search URL for specific sites, make the search general to work on any website.
3. Making separate Java files instead of just one.
