# SearchEZ
Thanks for checking out SearchEZ!

SearchEZ is aimed to be a simple utility that will allow users to find the cheapest price of a product across various e-commerce websites.
Currently the program only implements a GUI that will give you the URL of searched keyword on Amazon, Flipkart, Shopclues and Snapdeal. (More sites to be added soon!)

What's New?
1.Removed ebay from the program due to non availabilty in iNdia 
2. Added buttons instead of Textfields for websites, which when clicked will directly open the link on your default browser
3. Added 2 more e-commerce websites (Shopclues and Snapdeal).
4. Added an attractive background image to the window.
5. Added an attractive icon to the program.
6. "Open All" button will be added to directly open all the sites. (Will be removed shortly)

For next patch: 
1. Check if the product is available on the website or not.
2. If available, the price and link of the product will be fetched.

Remaining objectives:
1. Obtaining the desired product itself from the search URL.
2. Getting price of the product and sorting it, if product is unavailable on a site then it will be excluded.
