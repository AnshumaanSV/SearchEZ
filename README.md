# SearchEZ
Thanks for checking out SearchEZ!

The first prototype of SearchEZ is now live! Now instantly get the listing of your desired product on Amazon and Flipkart(More sites to be added soon!) along with the buy link. Find the cheaper listing and don't regret later, because searching across e-commerce sites just got EZier!

What's New?
1. Updated cleaner UI!
2. Actual price and buy link of the desired product added.
3. Handled certain cases of Amazon and Flipkart not opening buy link.
4. Temporarily fixed Amazon showing "Product not found".

For next patch: 
1. Few new websites will be added.
2. Currently the program is not at all handled for wrong links, so you may get wrong product. To be soon fixed.
3. Issue with Amazon showing "Product not found" will be further investigated.

**THE ENTIRE CODE IS WRITTEN WITH JAVA AWT AS IT'S GUI. I WILL BE REWRITING THE ENTIRE CODE ONCE AGAIN USING SWING, SO EVERYTHING ELSE IS ON HOLD. SECOND AND FINAL PROTOTYPE WILL BE LIVE ON 1st JANUARY!**
