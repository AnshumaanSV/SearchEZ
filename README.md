# SearchEZ
Thanks for checking out SearchEZ!

SearchEZ is aimed to be a simple utility that will allow users to find the cheapest price of a product across various e-commerce websites.
Currently the program only implements a GUI that will give you the URL of searched keyword on Amazon, Flipkart, Ebay, Shopclues and Snapdeal. (More sites to be added soon!)

What's New?
1. Added buttons instead of Textfields for websites, which when clicked will directly open the link on your default browser
2. Added 2 more e-commerce websites (Shopclues and Snapdeal).
3. Added an attractive background image to the window.

For next patch:
1. Check if the product is available on the website or not.
2. If available, the price will be fetched.

Remaining objectives:
1. Obtaining the desired product itself from the search URL.
2. Getting price of the product and sorting it, if product is unavailable on a site then it will be excluded.

Issues to be fixed:
1. Display the URLs text field only after the user has given the input.
2. Instead of hardcoding the search URL for specific sites, make the search general to work on any website.
3. Making separate Java files instead of just one.
